I am currently a Staff Research Scientist at [Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com/) and a Visiting Scholar at [Stanford University](https://www.devo-evo.com/#about). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I was advised by Prof. [Jiliang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WtzKMWAAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, under the supervision of Prof. [Pedro Szekely](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U1A6iBMAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also the founder of [OmicsML](https://github.com/OmicsML), a non-profit organization dedicated to developing open-source computational tools that accelerate scientific discovery through Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.
