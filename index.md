<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Staff Research Scientist at [Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com/) and a Visiting Scholar at [Stanford University](https://www.devo-evo.com/#about), where I am fortunate to work with Professor Xiaojie Qiu in the [Qiu Lab](https://www.devo-evo.com/#about). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I was advised by Prof. [Jiliang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WtzKMWAAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, under the supervision of Prof. [Pedro Szekely](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U1A6iBMAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also the founder of [OmicsML](https://github.com/OmicsML), a non-profit organization dedicated to developing open-source computational tools that accelerate scientific discovery through Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI. In addition, I regularly serve as PC member, and reviewers for leading international conferences and journals in machine learning and data science, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, AISTATS, AAAI, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, and journals such as npj Artificial Intelligence, Genome Biology, Communications Biology, Pattern Recognition, and Patterns.
